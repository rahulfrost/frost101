								Adler sets forth his method for reading a non-fiction book in order to gain understanding. He claims that three distinct approaches, or readings, possible out of a book, but that performing these three levels of readings does not necessarily mean reading the book three times, as the experienced reader will be able to do all three in the course of reading the book just once. Adler names the readings "structural", "interpretative", and "critical", in that order.
