                    <p>As you read, your mind becomes detached from the present moment, enabling you to concentrate on the words in front of you. Reading can transform your outlook on the events happening around you, aiding you in developing into the individual you aspire to become.</p>

                        To improve our understanding of the world and others, reading enhances self-confidence, self-awareness, empathy, and emotional intelligence. It broadens our imagination and exposes us to diverse experiences, enabling us to think critically and analytically as well as reflect on our beliefs. This perspective ultimately enhances our self-awareness and emotional intelligence.

                        language processing but also boosts cerebral blood flow. Furthermore, it stimulates the motor cortex, which is responsible for physical movement, and activates regions of the brain linked to sensory experiences, including the olfactory bulb, which plays a critical role in our sense of smell.

                        Reading fiction can light up the brain in a similar way to experiencing what you are reading. For instance, if you read about a character trekking through the wilderness, your brain reacts as if you are on that hike. Similarly, if you read about a character sipping lemonade, the part of your brain that responds to sour tastes is activated, and you may even start to salivate. This means that reading fiction can help you understand the experiences of others, bringing you closer to empathy. However, it is not the same as actually waking up as someone else, and it is much less creepy than body-swapping movies.

                        Not only do our peers benefit from a great story through the practice of empathy, but we can benefit personally as well. Reading books is a great confidence-builder. Author and self-described introvert Susan Cain states that, because many writers are introverts, so are their protagonists. They have contemplative, cerebral, and intellectual personality traits.
